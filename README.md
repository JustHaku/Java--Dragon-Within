# Java--Dragon-Within
A Jsfml 2D RPG created for a university group project.

The Dragon Within is an open world story driven game with an element based battle system, and old school inspired item design.

The game is set in a fantasy, medieval world, Glakevar a realm that is guarded by mythical, gigantic, fire-
spewing dragons. The dragons maintained peace for centuries in the realm, but for unknown reasons, the 
dragons suddenly started dying out, leaving all the people of the kingdom unprotected. With only a few 
dragons remaining and very soon none, the kingdomâ€™s integrity and its future are a question for another day.
